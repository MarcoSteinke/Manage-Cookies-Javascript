## Features:

#### 1. `Set` a cookie:

```javascript
function setCookie(name, value, exdays) {
    var d, expires;
    exdays = exdays || 1;
    d = new Date();
    d.setTime(d.getTime() + (exdays2460601000));
    expires = "expires=" + d.toUTCString();
    document.cookie = name + "=" + value + "; " + expires;
}
```
#### Usage:

```javascript
setCookie('name', 'Batman', 365);
```

'''


#### 2. `Read` a cookie:

```javascript
function getCookie(name) {
    var cookie, c;
    cookies = document.cookie.split(';');
    for (var i=0; i < cookies.length; i++) {
        c = cookies[i].split('=');
        if (c[0] == name) {
            return c[1];
        }
    }
    return "";
}
```

#### Usage: 

```javascript
getCookie(name);
```

'''

#### 3. `Delete` a cookie:

```javascript
setCookie('name', '', -1);
```

IMPORTANT: You can easily delete a cookie by settings its duration to `-1`!
